// Updated code that resolves the unexpected behavior by adjusting class order or adding utility classes. 
// The specific solution will depend on the root cause identified during debugging.
// Example solutions
// 1. Correcting class order to resolve potential conflicts
/*<div class="flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-100 p-4">
   <p class="text-2xl font-bold">This should work!</p>
</div>*/
// 2. Adding utility classes to override conflicting styles
/*<div class="flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-100 p-4">
   <p class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-500">This should work!</p>
</div>*/
